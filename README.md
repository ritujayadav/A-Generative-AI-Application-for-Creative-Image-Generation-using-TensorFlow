## Description
"Artistic GAN" is an exciting Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) application that uses TensorFlow and Keras to create captivating and artistic images. The project employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a powerful deep learning technique that enables the generation of unique and imaginative visuals.

## How it Works
Generative Adversarial Networks consist of two neural networks - the Generator and the Discriminator. The Generator tries to create beautiful and artistic images from random noise, while the Discriminator acts as an art critic, attempting to differentiate between real and AI-generated images. As they compete, the Generator continuously improves its artistry to produce increasingly realistic and visually appealing images.

## Key Features
- Creative and unique AI-generated artwork.
- Diverse styles, patterns, and color palettes in generated images.
- Use of open-source TensorFlow and Keras libraries for AI implementation.
- Easy-to-use and extensible code for further experimentation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## How to Use
1. Run the  script to train the GAN on the MNIST dataset.
2. The GAN will create and save the generated artwork in the `generated_images` folder.


## Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve and expand the capabilities of "Artistic GAN." If you find any issues or have ideas for enhancements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
